# PhantomTrafficSimulator ðŸš—ðŸ’¨  

A Python-based traffic flow simulator built with **Pygame** to study and visualize **phantom traffic jams** â€” sudden slowdowns that occur without an obvious cause.  

### âœ¨ Features
- Simulates cars moving along a road with adjustable speed and spacing.  
- Demonstrates how small disturbances can trigger large-scale traffic jams.  
- Provides a testbed for future integration with **AI models** (e.g., YOLO) to detect and analyze traffic anomalies.  

### ðŸ”§ Tech Stack
- Python  
- Pygame  

### ðŸŽ¯ Purpose
This project serves as part of my research on **phantom traffic detection** using deep learning models, combining simulation with AI for traffic pattern analysis.
